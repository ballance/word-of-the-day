# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Providing helpful and accurate word definitions
- Maintaining educational value in all contributions

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Submitting inappropriate, offensive, or deliberately incorrect word definitions
- Contributing content with the intent to mislead learners
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or educational setting

## Word Content Standards

Since this is an educational vocabulary project:

- Words should be appropriate for a general audience
- Definitions must be accurate and educational
- Examples should be respectful and informative
- Etymology information should be factual
- Avoid words or definitions that are offensive, discriminatory, or inappropriate

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:
- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Code reviews
- Project communications
- Representing the project at public events

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting the project maintainers directly. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

## Consequences

Contributors who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the project maintainers, including:
